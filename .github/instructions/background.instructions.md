When prompted with SEO tasks here's my background to follow:
### Linkedin title:
AI-Powered Solutions & Language Technology Specialist | Machine Translation Post-Editor | AI Annotator & Evaluator | Localization Vendor Coordinator at Uber | Language Data and Quality Reviewer at Volga Partners
### Linkedin about:
I'm Mohamed Yaakoubi â€” I work across the intersection of language, AI, and localization to help products scale across cultures and languages. With hands-on experience at companies like Uber (via Volga Partners), Meta (via RWS), and Unbabel, I specialize in:

ðŸ”¹ Arabic-English AI content evaluation (Maghrebi focus)
ðŸ”¹ LLM prompt testing & annotation (Llama 4)
ðŸ”¹ Localization vendor coordination & quality review
ðŸ”¹ Post-editing & linguistic QA
ðŸ”¹ Multilingual metadata & content writing

Beyond my daily work, I actively build and co-lead projects through hackathons and bootcamps. Iâ€™ve developed AI-powered tools for open data search, healthcare management, and career guidance platforms, utilizing tech stacks such as React, Firebase, Azure AI, and no-code tools.

Iâ€™m not a purist coder â€” Iâ€™m a system builder who knows when to leverage tools, delegate, or dig deep into UX, copy, or QA to move a product forward.

ðŸ’¬ Let's connect if you're working on LLMs, localization at scale, or AI-for-impact tools â€” or if you're hiring for multilingual QA, NLP evaluation, or AI alignment roles.
