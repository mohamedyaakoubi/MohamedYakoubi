### Linkedin title:
AI-Powered Solutions & Language Technology Specialist | Machine Translation Post-Editor | AI Annotator & Evaluator | Localization Vendor Coordinator at Uber | Language Data and Quality Reviewer at Volga Partners
### Linkedin about:
I'm Mohamed Yaakoubi — I work across the intersection of language, AI, and localization to help products scale across cultures and languages. With hands-on experience at companies like Uber (via Volga Partners), Meta (via RWS), and Unbabel, I specialize in:

🔹 Arabic-English AI content evaluation (Maghrebi focus)
🔹 LLM prompt testing & annotation (Llama 4)
🔹 Localization vendor coordination & quality review
🔹 Post-editing & linguistic QA
🔹 Multilingual metadata & content writing

Beyond my daily work, I actively build and co-lead projects through hackathons and bootcamps. I’ve developed AI-powered tools for open data search, healthcare management, and career guidance platforms, utilizing tech stacks such as React, Firebase, Azure AI, and no-code tools.

I’m not a purist coder — I’m a system builder who knows when to leverage tools, delegate, or dig deep into UX, copy, or QA to move a product forward.

💬 Let's connect if you're working on LLMs, localization at scale, or AI-for-impact tools — or if you're hiring for multilingual QA, NLP evaluation, or AI alignment roles.
